# Project Roadmap

## First Pass (current)

* Update naming conventions (need to codify somewhere)
* Remove networking and lookahead code
* Unit tests
* Move util functions from top-level to new util "module"
* Create valid_handle utility function to reduce duplication


## Misc To Do

* Review "header version" to see what needs to be accounted for in code
